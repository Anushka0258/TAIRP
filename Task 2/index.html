                        <li> ▢¼ cup coriander leaves
                            <li> ▢6 tbsp oil

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine wheat flour, coarse wheat flour, and salt.
                <li>  Crush cumin seeds, white sesame seeds, and ajwain using a rolling pin and add them to the flour mixture.
                    <li> Add hing, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, coriander powder, garam masala, and chopped coriander leaves.
                        <li>  Pour in the oil and mix everything well with your hands. The flour should have a crumbly texture and bind together when pressed between your hands.
                            <li>  Gradually add water while kneading to form a tight dough for the bhakri.
                                <li> Cover the dough and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
                                    <li> Take a medium-sized portion of the dough and roll it out into a bigger-sized, medium-thick bhakri.
                                        <li> Use a small-sized lid to cut out bhakri pieces and repeat the process with the remaining dough.
                                            <li> Heat a tawa or griddle on medium heat and place the rolled bhakri on it.
                                                <li> Cook each portion of the bhakri dough on both sides until golden brown, applying light pressure using a wooden press to ensure even cooking.
                                                    <li> Cook the bhakhri on medium heat until golden brown spots appear on both sides.
                                                        <li> Apply some ghee on both sides of the bhakhri and roast it for an additional 2 minutes to make it flakier.
                                                            <li> Serve the biscuit bhakhri immediately or store it in an airtight container.
